    I had a blast working with the NFB and director Randall Okita on this project.     
    I got use some Unity features for the first time like <b>Timeline</b> and the <b>Universal Render Pipeline</b>. 
    I learned to capture and integrate <b>motion capture</b> animation data using an XSens suite (I even jumped in the suit for a few sessions).

I programmed a lot of interactions and effects for this game, including a paint brush reveal effect using a <b>compute shader</b> and having hundreds of plants grow in a field where you throw seeds.
I am also very proud of the blast and paper desolve effect. It was important to get the right tone for this moment and I worked very closely with Randall to get it right.
