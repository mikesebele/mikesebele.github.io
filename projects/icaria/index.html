Wings of Icaria is an upcomming VR title by Little Guy Games. 
I was lead developer on the project from March 2018 to April 2019. 
My major contributions were inplementing visual effects and performance 
overhauls. I learned a lot about shader programming while creating the 
water shader for the game.

I also made the wormhole effect seen at the end of the trailer.
